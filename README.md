## TLDW:

The team designed a system (app) to solve the problem of a busy gym by informing gym-goers with real-time availability and predictive forecasts for specific granular level gym equipment.

Key Takeaway: By focusing on primary stakeholders' problems and centering the solution around their needs we can make a measurable positive impact.
